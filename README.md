N doors are present in a row that are all initially closed.
• Make N passes by each of these doors
• The first time through, visit every door and ‘toggle’ the door (if the door is closed, open
it; if it is open, close it).
• The second time, only visit every 2nd door (i.e., door #2, #4, #6, ...) and toggle it.
• The third time, visit every 3 rd door (i.e., door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc., until you only visit the
N th door on the N th pass.
